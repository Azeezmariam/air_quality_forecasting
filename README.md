# Air Quality Forecasting Project

## Overview

This project focuses on forecasting air quality levels based on historical data. The goal is to predict air pollution levels (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2) using machine learning models. The dataset includes various environmental and meteorological features that influence air quality.

## Requirements

To replicate the results of this project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dependencies include:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
xgboost
lightgbm
tensorflow (if using neural networks)
jupyter (for running notebooks)
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains air quality readings along with meteorological data. It is recommended to download the data from [insert data source URL]. The data should be stored in the data/ folder.

## Instructions to Reproduce Results
# Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Run the data_preprocessing.py script to clean and preprocess the data. This step includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py

# Step 2: Model Training
After preprocessing the data, you can train different machine learning models. The model.py script trains a variety of models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

```bash
python src/model.py

# Step 3: Model Evaluation
Once the models are trained, run the following to evaluate their performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².

```bash
python src/model.py --evaluate

# Step 4: Forecasting
For making predictions with the trained model, use the prediction.py script. You will need to pass the data for prediction and specify which model to use.

```bash
python src/prediction.py --model xgboost --input new_data.csv

This will output the forecasted air quality values for the provided input.

## Key Findings 
We found that certain meteorological features, such as temperature and humidity, are strongly correlated with pollution levels.
XGBoost outperformed other models such as Random Forest and Linear Regression in terms of prediction accuracy.

##  Future Work
Experiment with more advanced models, including deep learning approaches like LSTM for time series forecasting.
Incorporate additional external data such as traffic patterns, which could further improve prediction accuracy.
